Moodify – Version 1 (Basic Console Edition)  
Moodify V1 is a mood based music recommender built in Java. Users select how they feel from a menu of moods, and the program displays a curated list of song suggestions that match the selected mood. This initial version uses a text file as its data source, helping establish the baseline functionality before expanding into mood analysis and API integration in future versions.
